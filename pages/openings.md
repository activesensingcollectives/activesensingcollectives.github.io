## PhD position: Characterising biological active-sensing swarms in the field 
What is actually happening inside a swarm of active-sensing agents? Echolocating bats show all kinds of collective movements from linear emergence to fly-like swarms. How are they able to manage despite what we expect to be a complex auditory scene? What is actually happening in a swarm of echolocating bats?

This project consists of building a next-generation multi-sensor setup consisting of microphone arrays, acoustic & thermal cameras, as well as LiDAR scans of active-sensing swarms. Aside from building the multi-sensor setup the candidate will also be involved in the development and analysis of this exciting multi-sensor dataset to reveal individual sensory umwelts and sensorimotor decisions in groups. The project will consist of first assembling individual commercially available sensors into a usable system. The system will then be deployed in the field to capture bat collective behaviours.

The candidate is expected to have experience/background in at least two among the list of fields, along with a willingness to learn:

* Sensory biology/animal behaviour (previous experience with any kind of animal tracking in audio/video is helpful)	
* Acoustics/physics/engineering 	
* Computational science/ programming (previous experience in Python is helpful).

A driving license and field work experience is beneficial.

Candidates will be hired in the E13 scheme according to the full-time equivalent of the University of Konstanz.

<!-- As a PhD candidate in the lab, you will be based either in the Biology graduate school or the IMPRS QBEE programs at the University of Konstanz, and be part of a vibrant community of researchers working across various fields.-->

## PhD/Postdoc position: The Ro-BAT platform: investigating workable solutions to active-sensing in robot swarms

What strategies can agents in swarms when they are faced with too much irrelevant and too little relevant information at the same time? This is what active-sensing agents like echolocating bats face in groups. From a technological perspective active-sensing agents that can manage the 'noise' while also swarming promise an energy and computationally ideal platform for swarm robotics. From a biological perspective, the study of echolocating bat groups reveals various strategies that individuals use, while also showing species-specific patterns that seem hard to understand and control for.

This project will build on the 'Ro-BAT' active-sensing robotics platform we have been developing and scale it to study the dynamics of active-sensing robot swarms. The project will include iterating on the RO-BAT platform's hardware and software components, designing swarm robotics experiments with controlled factorial designs as well as artificial evolution experiments. 
The candidate is expected to have experience/background in at least two among the list of fields:

* collective behaviour	
* acoustics/physics/engineering	
* computational science/robotics (previous experience in Python is helpful)
	
This is an interdisciplinary project involving close collaboration with [Dr. Andreagiovanni Reina](https://www.giovannireina.com/) & [Prof. Heiko Hamann](http://embodied-computation.org/) at the Department of Computer and Information Science in the Uni. Konstanz. 


Candidates will be hired in the E13 scheme according to the full-time equivalent of the University of Konstanz.
