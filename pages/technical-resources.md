This is a constantly updated list of some of our lab's equipment-specific and workflow based know-how and code. 

## Lab Network-attach storage
Info on using + accessing the lab's network attached storage [here](https://github.com/activesensingcollectives/device-related/blob/main/AcSeCoLab_NAS/AcSeCoLabNAS.txt)

### Methods

* [Microphone calibration through the substitution method](https://github.com/activesensingcollectives/calibrate-mic)
* [Designing a mic calibration experiment based on the room dimensions](https://github.com/activesensingcollectives/how-to/blob/master/designing_calibration_experiments.pdf)

### Device-specific

* [Fireface 802 gain and Vclip measurements](https://github.com/activesensingcollectives/device-related/blob/main/gainknob_fireface802/estimating_Vclip_and_gain.pdf)

* [Lab-grade calibration mic sensitivity measurements](https://github.com/activesensingcollectives/device-related/tree/main/gras_microphone_calibration_certificates)

* Broad how-to notes to use the Trimble C5 total station ([link1 ](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/s/9gAPYfQyS7simN6), [link2 needs Uni account](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/f/194926655)

* StonexR20 user-manual [link](https://www.geo-sensor.net/download/Stonex/Manuals.Hardware/Stonex_R20_Handbuch_1.13_EN.pdf) and [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKxUn7xzyb5ELAuCzhpvMWoFtbTUNi2D8). 
	* In addition - a broader run-through on how to do the typical things you would need for our use-cases [here](https://github.com/activesensingcollectives/device-related/blob/main/stonex_r20_notes/stonex_setup_and_user-notes.md)

* User-manual and some notes on using the Trion P1 scanner [link](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/f/202268590)

* CAE-Soundcam Software v2.3c with LAN based triggering (to run the acoustic camera). [Link (permission needed)](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/f/206662799)

### Robot platform specific

* Instructions to run the SonoRo and RoBAT platforms ([link](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/f/215830691) - will need Uni Konstanz login + permissions)
